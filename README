Generate monthly bill and CDR files for phone users based on two CSV files - one containing a record of calls and the other containing billing information.

The correct formatting for the call record CSV is:
[Caller number],[Callee number],[Call duration in seconds],[Date and time of call, formatted as yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss]

The correct formatting for the rate billing CSV is:
[Region code],[Region code name],[Call price with decimals separated by a dot]

A user profile for each calling party will be generated and used to produce monthly bill and call record / CDR files.

Correct usage of the program is:
[Executable] -r [Call rate CSV file] -c [Call record CSV file]

Optional arguments:
	-h	Help
